### Credit:  Inbar Avital and Noam Yakov
## Description:
This is a C++ project that basicaly solves problems.
In the example we ran it on, it runs different algorithems and chooses the best one for each input.
It is using a well designed base-code and structure, so it easy to add any problem we want to, and solve it! :)

## Installation and Running
Install the files clicking the green "***clone or download***" button, and choose the preffered option.

#### Compile the program using this command:
> g++ -std=c++14 \*/*.cpp *.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -o a.out -pthread

#### and then run it with:
> ./a.out PORT_NUMBER
```(change the PORT_NUMBER to be the port number you want your server to run on)```
